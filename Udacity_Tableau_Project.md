## Introduction
I chose the baseball dataset for my explanatory data visualization project to look for relationships or patterns by using Tableau. Below are the initial version of my story and the Final version, after feedback:

## Summary
The data set contains 1,157 baseball players. I first started by creating some visuals to shows some of the properties and relationships based on baseball players data, including handedness, weight, height, battling average(BA) and home runs(HR).

### Design

#### Initial Version
I started my first visualization using a bar plot for Handedness. The data shows most of the
players are right handed. 

On my second visual, I created a scatter plot based on the players height and weight.  It shows that most of the players weigh between 160 to 220 lbs, and their heights are between 65 to 80 inches.  

The next two visuals are bar charts showing the top players with the highest BA and HR based off their handedness.  I found that the top players for both BA and HR are left handed.

Next up is a scatter plot between HR and BA There is high density of player in BA ranging from 0.19 - 0.28, and HR between 0 and 100.

After the dashboard showing the handedness scatter plot and bar charts, the remaining visualizations are line charts for BA vs weight, BA vs height, HR vs weight, and HR vs height. 

For the BA vs. Height line chart, the data shows the highest average battling players are 67 inches in height.
For BA vs. Weight line chart, the highest average battling players weigh 201 lbs.
For the HR vs. Height line chart, the highest average home run players are 67 inches in height.
For the HR vs. Weight line chart, the highest average home run players weigh 209 lbs.

I chose line charts here because variables weight and height are continuous, and line plots are
work well for showing continuous variables. Audiences can easily see the relationship between both variables.


## Feedback

" Your visualizations look excellent.  One thing I would recommend though is to provide a little intro your dataset.  Imagine that your readers does not know about the dataset.  Otherwise, I think your visualization look great and you’ve done a great job conveying to your readers what you’re trying to show through them."

#### Feedback Update

Added a short intro/explanation of the dataset under the title
