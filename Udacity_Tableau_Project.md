# Data Vizualization - Baseball Player Performance

## Introduction
I chose the baseball dataset for my explanatory data visualization project to look for relationships or patterns by using Tableau. Below are the initial version of my story and the Final version, after feedback:

## Summary
The data set contains 1,157 baseball players. I started by creating some visuals to shows some of the properties and relationships based on baseball players data.  I will create a visualizataion to analyze perfomance of players and which players are the top performers.

### Design

#### Initial Version
I started my first visualization using a bar plot for Handedness.

On my second visual, I created a scatter plot based on the players height and weight. 

The next two visuals are bar charts showing the top players with the highest BA and HR based off their handedness.  

Next up is a scatter plot between HR and BA there is high density of player in BA ranging from 0.19 - 0.28, and HR between 0 and 100.

After the dashboard showing the handedness scatter plot and bar charts, the remaining visualizations are line charts for BA vs weight, BA vs height, HR vs weight, and HR vs height. I chose line charts here because variables weight and height are continuous, and line plots are work well for showing continuous variables. Audiences can easily see the relationship between both variables.


## Feedback

" Your visualizations look excellent.  One thing I would recommend though is to provide a little intro your dataset.  Imagine that your readers does not know about the dataset.  Otherwise, I think your visualization look great and you’ve done a great job conveying to your readers what you’re trying to show through them."

#### Feedback Update

Added a short intro/explanation of the dataset under the title
